          We the community of Catholic Christians of Ugandan origin in the
          Archdiocese of Boston, Accepting that each and every one of us has
          been chosen by God to be a worker in His vineyard and a builder of His
          kingdom here on earth; Mindful that the family is the domestic Church
          where the faith is first caught and taught; Believing that God is
          already at work among us and within the global fellowship of the Roman
          Catholic Church; Entrusting ourselves to the intercession of the
          Blessed Virgin Mary and the holy Martyrs of Uganda;

          teachings of the Roman Catholic Church. It is a family of believers

        <p className="main_paragraph">
          The objectives of the Ugandan Catholic Community in the Archdiocese of
          Boston shall be:
          <br /> To gather regularly to pray, celebrate the holy sacraments,
          share love with one another and strengthen fellowship that transcends
          tribal, ethnic, gender, age and/or generational differences.
          <br /> To harness the different gifts, talents, energies, efforts, and
          ministries among the members.
          <br /> To support and be a voice for the voiceless, the sick and
          afflicted, prisoners, as well as weakened and alienated believers
          within the community, and beyond.
          <br /> To raise future generations of Catholic citizens and leaders
          from younger members of the Community in a lively and reassuring
          atmosphere where children, young adults, and the youth feel welcomed,
          included, supported, nurtured, and mentored.
          <br /> To act as a bridge between the Archdiocese of Boston, the wider
          Catholic Church in America, the Catholic Church in Uganda, and society
          at large, by arranging and encouraging visits, and exchanges of
          spiritual, material, social, and cultural gifts.
          <br /> To spearhead the annual celebration of the Uganda Martyrsâ€Ÿ Day
          by the Ugandans in greater Boston, and to ultimately promote this
          celebration to the status of a major feast of the Archdiocese of
          Boston.
          <br /> To seek integration into and interaction with the local
          Community of the Archdiocese of Boston, while encouraging and
          promoting Ugandan cultural expressions of Catholic liturgy and
          worship.
          <br /> To conceive and support the development of programs and
          activities that generate socioeconomic and professional growth among
          Community members.
