          We the community of Catholic Christians of Ugandan origin in the
          Archdiocese of Boston, Accepting that each and every one of us has
          been chosen by God to be a worker in His vineyard and a builder of His
          kingdom here on earth; Mindful that the family is the domestic Church
          where the faith is first caught and taught; Believing that God is
          already at work among us and within the global fellowship of the Roman
          Catholic Church; Entrusting ourselves to the intercession of the
          Blessed Virgin Mary and the holy Martyrs of Uganda;

          united, lively, thriving, loving, and caring community of Christians
          walking together on their shared journey of faith, according to the
          teachings of the Roman Catholic Church. It is a family of believers
          boldly professing, openly celebrating, and clearly living out their
          Catholic faith together with the local community of the Archdiocese of
          Boston, enriched by their Ugandan Catholic experience; and ready and
          willing to promote general and specific self improvement among her
