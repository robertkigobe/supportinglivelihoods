                Greetings to everyone, In these challenging times we all find
                ourselves in, I thought that a message reminding us of the
                importance of personal and team endurance, and encouraging one
                another to persevere would be helpful. So the full title of our
                Message is: “ENDURING EFFORT, Holds The Key” UCCB said this on

                Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random
                text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from
