                Greetings to everyone, In these challenging times we all find
                ourselves in, I thought that a message reminding us of the
                importance of personal and team endurance, and encouraging one
                another to persevere would be helpful. So the full title of our
                Message is: “ENDURING EFFORT, Holds The Key” UCCB said this on
                the topic; "Continuous EFFORT{" "}

                UCCB’s Attachment To The Uganda Martyrs For clarity’s sake, UCCB
                stands for the Ugandan Catholic Community in the Archdiocese of
                Boston. And the Uganda Martyrs in reference here are none other
                than the Ugandan Christian Martyrs – most specifically the 22
                Catholic Martyrs, who were killed at the orders of Kabaka (King)
                Mwanga of the Kingdom of Buganda in Uganda in the late 19th
                Century for being Christians. That is, Kabaka Mwanga killed them
                because of their adherence to the Christian Faith. Even though
                the majority of these Christian Faithful were killed at
                Nnamugongo, we know very well that some were killed at other
                sites in the Kingdom of Buganda. Consequently, because of this
                historical fact, the most prominent Shrine for the Uganda
                Catholic Martyrs is at Nnamugongo. However, at this juncture, we
                cannot feign ignorance of the other Christian Martyrs who
                belonged to the Anglican Church and were at the same time also
                killed at the Kabaka’s orders for the
